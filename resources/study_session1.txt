Definitions:
  Navier-Stokes equations: Equations that govern the mechanics of fluids. 2 Equations in total:
	    Conservation of mass: Gradient of the velocity in a three dimensional space + Newton's second law: Acceleration * Mass = Inner Forces + Outter Forces.
    	The solutions do not always converge due to TURBULENCE. Possible ways of solving it: assumptions (initial conditions), Finite time (or space too maybe?). 
      
  Turbulence: due to non-linearity of Navier-Stockes equations. Can be calculated but it is computationally expensive, thus emerged the need to model the phenomenon. 
        In the case of our study, we use the RANS model.
        
Problematic:
    The turbulence is quite random and very challenging to compute, therfore, it can be very problematic computationally.
        
Classic Solution:
    Averaging time: introduces a new stress tensor (RANS model, which stands for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-stokes), consequently more unknowns
        => the need for experimental correlation or closure coefficients to calculate the unknowns.
    Constraints: 
	    - It is purely experimental (probably requires more time and effort and lacks precision?)
	    - The transition state (from laminar to turbulent) is not taken into account. If it was the case, it would introduce more unknowns and therefore more computational effort
 
 Task: 
    - Use Machine Learning to tune the closure coefficients without having to do it experimentally.

Questions/answers:
    - Antonin & Marvellous: Would we have enough data to train our model and was it collected accurately (preprocessing step)?
