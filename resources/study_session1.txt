Definitions:
  Navier-Stokes equations: Equations that govern the mechanics of fluids. 2 Equations in total:
	    Conservation of mass: Gradient of the velocity in a three dimensional space + Newton's second law: Acceleration * Mass = Inner Forces + Outter Forces.
    	The solutions do not always converge due to TURBULENCE. Possible ways of solving it: assumptions (initial conditions), Finite time (or space too maybe?). 
      
  Turbulence: due to non-linearity of Navier-Stockes equations. Can be calculated but it is computationally expensive, thus emerged the need to model the phenomenon. 
        In the case of our study, we use the RANS model.

  Types of Machine Learning: 
   	Supervised Learning: Maps an input to an output based on io pairs. It is the most used type of ML. Methods: Classification - Regression - Neural Networks (Probably the one we will be using) 
	Unsupervised Learning: Only the input is available and the task is to identify and categorize datasets. Methods: Clustering - Association
	Reinforcement Learning: The goal is to come up with a sequence of actions that form a good policy based on the past sequences.

  Methodology of a ML implementation:
	1- Collection of data
	2- Preprocessing
	3- Transformation
	4- Analysis
	5- Interpretation and Evaluation

   Deep Learning: A type of ML that combines Big Data and Computer Computation. Generally more performant. Methods: Deep Neural Networks (one input, one output, multiple hidden layers)

Problematic:
    The turbulence is quite random and very challenging to compute, therfore, it can be very problematic computationally.
    The ultimate task of the project is to develop a solution based on ML algorithms that can produce accurate Transition models based on the experimental data we have.
        
Classic Solution:
    Averaging time: introduces a new stress tensor (RANS model, which stands for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-stokes), consequently more unknowns
        => the need for experimental correlation or closure coefficients to calculate the unknowns.
    Constraints: 
	    - It is purely experimental (probably requires more time and effort and lacks precision?)
	    - The transition state (from laminar to turbulent) is not taken into account. If it was the case, it would introduce more unknowns and therefore more computational effort
 
APIs/Software/Libraries:
    TensorFlow: an open source for Machine/Deep Learning. Written in Python, C++ and CUDA. One of the most used tools in AI. Can be executed on both GPUs and CPUs (Possible use of OpenMP and CUDA in addition to MPI).
    Scikit-learn: A free ML library "for Python" and written in Python. (probably not a good idea to use it for its limited performance)
    Keras: most used Deep Learning API. can be built on top of TensorFlow and therefore work in a cluster environment and use GPUs.

Task: 
    - Use Machine Learning to tune the closure coefficients without having to do it experimentally.

Questions/answers:
    - Antonin & Marvellous: Would we have enough data to train our model and was it collected accurately (preprocessing step)? 
    - Dr Jun Li: This is an excellent question: It will be clearer when the data is available. But likely, the data will not be enough at some point for training a model. 
	Therefore, you have to come up with a solution to cope with this. One method is to generate new data based on the study of its distribution such as using some statistical methods. 
	Alternatively, one may use the synthetic data generation concept, which often uses machine learning methods such as neural networks - again implicitly simulating the data distribution. 
	The third way is related to your model itself - to see if it is capable with less datasets. This can be related a neural network architecture design if you use neural networks, 
	or sampling approach if you use some unsupervised learning as pre-processing for your model. More or less, you have to do pre-processing such as selection of features (e.g. closure of coefficients)
	and normalization of the model inputs...
	
    - Zakariae: How to modify the number of meshes? Can we do it using OpenFOAM?
    - Dr Tom Teschner: it needs to be done by the user (i.e. openfoam does not take care of that) but only if the reynolds number is changed. 
	If the Reynolds number is the same and only the angle of attack is changing, for example, we can use the same mesh and don't have to change it. 
	If we change the reynolds number, ten we have to copy the correct mesh into the constant directory. 
	As a sanity check, after each simulation we can check if the maximum yplus value reported is below 1 
	(either on the screen or inside the postProcessing/yPlus/ folder after the simulation has finished). If it is above 1, then we have probably used the wrong mesh
