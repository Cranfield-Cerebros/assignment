- keywords: binary classifiers - Galilean invariance - Group Theory
- The goal of the study presented in the document is the turbulence uncertainty quantification: predict when RANS 
	has high uncertainty based on when specific model assumptions are violated


- (for the project) A good approach would be to find a database that has both DNS and RANS results available (for some NACA models for example)
- Classifiers used: Adaboost DT, Random Forest, SVM
- results: 3x more accurate error detection
- (for the project) we can use rule extraction to understand how our program works

-Deep Learning for Turbulence Modelling: They used a Deep Neural Network 
- Embedding Galilean Invariance in a NN consists of using an additional Tensor Input Layer that is to be merged with the final layer to give the output layer.
- Tools used: Lasagne library for implementation - Bayesian optimisation to tune hyper-parameters
- Results: the Tensor Based Neural Network is more perfromant in all cases
	- Significantly improved Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions
