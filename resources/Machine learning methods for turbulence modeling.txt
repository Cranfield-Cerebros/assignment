Machine learning methods for turbulence modeling in subsonic flows over airfoils

Results calculated by Spallart-Allmaras (original model)
Use of RBFNN (radial basis function neural network) to model eddy viscosity
high reynolds -> thin boundary layer -> gradient & data range large
 -> separate the flow in different zones from the wall
 => reduces error near wall (still present though) + model parameters can be adapted in each zone (for example number of hidden neurons)

More hidden layers <=> improve modeling results but risks of overfitting and  low generalization

Learning ratios set to 0.01
K-means clustering used to divide the dataset into subsets
