Main points:
	
	- Intoduction: {Zakariae}
		- Develop a ML solution able to produce accurate models of Transition using Computational Methods.
		- Overview on the state of the art (give examples of companies/industries/research)

		script: - The main goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning Solution to tune the closure coefficients instead of 
			using an experimental and statistical approach. The approach we have in mind currently might not be the best one given that
			we are still not pretty clear on all the technical constraints, however, in this presentation, we will give what we think
			for now is the most suitable approach. We're also going to talk about the group formulation and the role of each one of us.
			and then finally present the high-level tasks that we have deemed pertinent for the moment.
			- Overview on the state of the art: We have identified multiple documents that are relevant to the topic at hand (mostly research papers)
			In general, there is a recent tendency to use Machine Learning in Computational Fluid Dynamics to replace computationally expensive methods.
			These Data-Driven methods have proved to be more efficient and provide more accuracy. Many organizations and universities are doing research
			in this area, especially for Turbulence Models. As far as now, the results are promising but still require more research. 

	- Group formulation:
		- Compatiblity of personalities: (INTJ) Zakariae, Salman (INTJ), Antonin (ISTJ), Marvellous (ENFJ)
		- SkillsMatrices: We make a complement team with potential synergy (go in depth)

		script: - Considering our types of personalities, we thought we would make a good team for multiple reasons:
			We have two INTJs, basically 2 masterminds that are good at setting strategies and problem-sovlers. We tend 
			to see possiblities for improvement and innovation, consequently, 2 INTJs in the same group must be a really
			good match and one can push the other to further thinking. We also think that it would keep the team intellectually 
			stimulated.
			The third member is ISTJ, called also Inspector. He's more driven to enforce order and organization which is a good match
			considering that we have 2 INTJs and due to their perfectionism, they tend to spend too much time on certain tasks, which
			is not always good for the project. Therefore, an inspector to remind the group of the deadlines and to enforce good time 
			management is perfect for the team.
			The fourth member is ENFJ, also called ENFJ. They are good organizers, much like ISTJ but tend to be more extraverted and 
			charismatic. A member like that is really good for the team to keep the spirits up since INTJs and ISTJs tend to be a bit 
			too serious. an ENFJ can motivate the group to be more productive.

			- Skills Matrices: The group was also formed while taking into account the skills matrices. We have noticed that each one of us
			compensates another member's weaknesses. For example, not all member feel comfortable with writing long reports and documentation
			whereas others are more comfortable with it and might even enjoy it. Another example is the coding tasks, some of us are good at
			programming whereas others are less comfortable with it, so obviously the ones that are good will focus on coding tasks while the 
			others can do progess in other aspects of the project. 

	 
	

	- Solution approach: {Salman}
		- Tree diagram representing to possible approaches (ML or DL) and proceed with elimination based on feasability
		- Neural Network with multiple algorithms (Monte Carlo algorithm - Bio-algorithm)
		- Programming language choice/APIs: 
			- Python as host language
			- C++/C for implementing algorithms/Use external libraries (for validation et cetera)
			- CUDA for Machine Learning (Keras+tensorFlow)
		- Visualization of Data (perhaps?)
		
	- Roles of each member: {Marvellous}
		- AI (ML/DP): Salman - Zakariae
		- Low-level coding (algorithms): Antonin - Marvellous - Zakariae
		- Theory related to the problem (mechanics): Salman - Marvellous - Zakariae - Antonin
		- Documentation (code documentation - reports - State of the art et cetera): Zakariae - Salman - Marvellous
		- Organization/time management (Agile method/GANT): Salman - Zakariae - Marvellous - Antonin
		- Communication (with third parties): Zakariae - Marvellous
		
	- High-level tasks: {Antonin}
		- Market analysis: State of the art of the available technologies/paradigms. Might be pertinent to focus on
			research papers, and probably look up businesses specialized in this area. Financial aspect - Market size
		- Software Requirements Specifications + UML diagrams 
		- A work plan/planning
		- Data Collection: (Opencv for extraction from images/ look up the original document online) + Generate more data if necessary
		- Preprocessing the data (Scikit-learn)
		- Transformation (Normalization of data)
		- Analysis (Learning phase)
		- Interpretation and Evaluation (Validation of the results)
