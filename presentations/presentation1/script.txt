Main points:
	
	- Intoduction: {Zakariae}
		- Develop a ML solution able to produce accurate models of Transition using Computational Methods.
		- Overview on the market analysis (give examples of companies/industries/research)

	- Group formulation:
		- Compatiblity of personalities: (INTJ) Zakariae, Salman (ENFP), Antonin (ISTJ), Marvellous (ENFJ)
		- SkillsMatrices: We make a complement team with potential synergy (go in depth)

	- Solution approach: {Salman}
		- Programming language choice/APIs: 
			- We have chosen Python as host language
			- and we will use C++/C for implementing algorithms/Use external libraries (for validation et cetera)
			- we also have plans to use CUDA for Machine Learning (Keras+tensorFlow)

		- Tree diagram representing to possible approaches (ML or DL) and proceed with elimination based on feasability
				
			Regression with gradient descent , 
		- Neural Network with multiple algorithms (Monte Carlo algorithm)
			-We will be taking advantage of tensorflow and keras libraries
			-we will be using monte carlo  simulation to generate closure coefficients
			-We may use perceptron model initially 
		
		- Visualization of Data (perhaps?)
				If we finish early we may use visualisation tehcniques to analyse and improve our results
		
	- Roles of each member: {Marvellous}
		- Two team members from SETC, one from CED and CIDA each.
		- There are technical and non-technical roles
		- Technical roles were chosen based on background, expertise and current option
			- AI (ML/DP): Salman - Zakariae
			- Low-level coding (algorithms): Antonin - Marvellous - Zakariae
			- Theory related to the problem (mechanics): Salman - Marvellous - Zakariae - Antonin
			- Documentation (code documentation - reports - State of the art et cetera): Zakariae - Salman - Marvellous
		- Non-technical roles were shared according to personality types
			- Organization/time management (Agile method/GANT): Salman - Zakariae - Marvellous - Antonin
			- Communication (with third parties): Zakariae - Marvellous
		- We would all work together irrespective of individual responsibilities.
		
	- High-level tasks: {Antonin}
		- Market analysis: State of the art of the available technologies/paradigms. Might be pertinent to focus on
			research papers, and probably look up businesses specialized in this area. Financial aspect - Market size
		- Software Requirements Specifications + UML diagrams 
		- A work plan/planning
		- Data Collection: (Opencv for extraction from images/ look up the original document online) + Generate more data if necessary
		- Preprocessing the data (Scikit-learn)
		- Transformation (Data transformation is the process of changing the format, structure, or values of data(normalisation))
		- Analysis (Learning phase)
		- Interpretation and Evaluation (Validation of the results)
	
		script:
			divided the project in phases:
				1. Prepare the environment we will use: SOA( tools available, regarding code libraries available), list of the specifications
				2. Work plan (agile method)
				3. Programming:
						-data collection (from the pdf) + creation of new datasets (if required)
						-preprocessing data (maybe Scikit-learn?) 
						-transformation (process of changing the format, structure, or values of data(normalisation))
						-analysis (Learning phase)
						-interpretation and evaluation (Validation of the results)
