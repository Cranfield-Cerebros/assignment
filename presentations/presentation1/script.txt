Main points:
	
	- Intoduction: {Zakariae}
		- Develop a ML solution able to produce accurate models of Transition using Computational Methods.
		- Overview on the market analysis (give examples of companies/industries/research)

	- Group formulation:
		- Compatiblity of personalities: (INTJ) Zakariae, Salman (INTJ), Antonin (ISTJ), Marvellous (ENFJ)
		- SkillsMatrices: We make a complement team with potential synergy (go in depth)

	- Solution approach: {Salman}
		- Tree diagram representing to possible approaches (ML or DL) and proceed with elimination based on feasability
		- Neural Network with multiple algorithms (Monte Carlo algorithm - Bio-algorithm)
		- Programming language choice/APIs: 
			- Python as host language
			- C++/C for implementing algorithms/Use external libraries (for validation et cetera)
			- CUDA for Machine Learning (Keras+tensorFlow)
		- Visualization of Data (perhaps?)
		
	- Roles of each member: {Marvellous}
		- AI (ML/DP): Salman - Zakariae
		- Low-level coding (algorithms): Antonin - Marvellous - Zakariae
		- Theory related to the problem (mechanics): Salman - Marvellous - Zakariae - Antonin
		- Documentation (code documentation - reports - State of the art et cetera): Zakariae - Salman - Marvellous
		- Organization/time management (Agile method/GANT): Salman - Zakariae - Marvellous - Antonin
		- Communication (with third parties): Zakariae - Marvellous
		
	- High-level tasks: {Antonin}
		- Market analysis: State of the art of the available technologies/paradigms. Might be pertinent to focus on
			research papers, and probably look up businesses specialized in this area. Financial aspect - Market size
		- Software Requirements Specifications + UML diagrams 
		- A work plan/planning
		- Data Collection: (Opencv for extraction from images/ look up the original document online) + Generate more data if necessary
		- Preprocessing the data (Scikit-learn)
		- Transformation (Normalization of data)
		- Analysis (Learning phase)
		- Interpretation and Evaluation (Validation of the results)
