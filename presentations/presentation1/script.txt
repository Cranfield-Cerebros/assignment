Main points:
	
	- Intoduction: {Zakariae}
		- Develop a ML solution able to produce accurate models of Transition using Computational Methods.
		- Overview on the market analysis (give examples of companies/industries/research)

	- Group formulation:
		- Compatiblity of personalities: (INTJ) Zakariae, Salman (ENFP), Antonin (ISTJ), Marvellous (ENFJ)
		- SkillsMatrices: We make a complement team with potential synergy (go in depth)

	- Solution approach: {Salman}
		Programming language choice/APIs: 
		- We have chosen Python as host language
		-As it Python is easy to use, powerful, and versatile, and its readability is very good compared to other languages.
	-Python's high speed for data processing makes it optimal for usage with Big Data
	-Also python has vast predefined librieries & tools which helps us to perform complex tasks in seconds.
	- We will use C++/C for implementing algorithms/ we may also employ some external libraries (for validation et cetera)
	- we also have plans to use CUDA for Machine Learning and optimisation
	
	-ML
		for machine learning part we ll mainly be performing multi variate Regression with gradient descent to converge
		to solution as Gradient descent is simply used to find the values of a function's parameters (coefficients) that minimize
		a cost function as far as possible

	- coming to the Neural Network part (Monte Carlo algorithm )

	Based on the outcome of our regression analysis 
	- We will further be improving upon by use of Neural networks as they work better at predictive analytics because of the hidden layers.
	 while linear regression models use only input and output nodes to make predictions. Neural network also use the hidden
	 layer to make predictions more accurate. That's because it 'learns' the way a human does.
	-We will be taking advantage of tensorflow and keras libraries
	-we will be using monte carlo  simulation to generate closure coefficients which on of the requirements
	Based on these results we will train our model till we achive satisfactory result
	
	- Visualization of Data (perhaps?)
				Our aim is to further improve our overall results using machine vision.
				If we finish early we may use visualisation tehcniques to analyse and improve our results

		
	- Roles of each member: {Marvellous}
		- Two team members from SETC, one from CED and CIDA each.
		- There are technical and non-technical roles
		- Technical roles were chosen based on background, expertise and current option
			- AI (ML/DP): Salman - Zakariae
			- Low-level coding (algorithms): Antonin - Marvellous - Zakariae
			- Theory related to the problem (mechanics): Salman - Marvellous - Zakariae - Antonin
			- Documentation (code documentation - reports - State of the art et cetera): Zakariae - Salman - Marvellous
		- Non-technical roles were shared according to personality types
			- Organization/time management (Agile method/GANT): Salman - Zakariae - Marvellous - Antonin
			- Communication (with third parties): Zakariae - Marvellous
		- We would all work together irrespective of individual responsibilities.
		
	- High-level tasks: {Antonin}
		- Market analysis: State of the art of the available technologies/paradigms. Might be pertinent to focus on
			research papers, and probably look up businesses specialized in this area. Financial aspect - Market size
		- Software Requirements Specifications + UML diagrams 
		- A work plan/planning
		- Data Collection: (Opencv for extraction from images/ look up the original document online) + Generate more data if necessary
		- Preprocessing the data (Scikit-learn)
		- Transformation (Data transformation is the process of changing the format, structure, or values of data(normalisation))
		- Analysis (Learning phase)
		- Interpretation and Evaluation (Validation of the results)
	
		script:
			divided the project in phases:
				1. Prepare the environment we will use: SOA( tools available, regarding code libraries available), list of the specifications
				2. Work plan (agile method)
				3. Programming:
						-data collection (from the pdf) + creation of new datasets (if required)
						-preprocessing data (maybe Scikit-learn?) 
						-transformation (process of changing the format, structure, or values of data(normalisation))
						-analysis (Learning phase)
						-interpretation and evaluation (Validation of the results)
